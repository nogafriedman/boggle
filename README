Boggle Game features:

- Main menu window as an aesthetic entry to the game:
The main menu has a score board (extra feature) that shows the top 3 scores of all time, by player name
and score. The score board is loaded with each run of the game root from a file in the exercise folder
/Resources/Data and the updated data is saved to the file when closing the game.
Before entering the game you can insert your name in the presented box,
if no name is inserted- the default name that's going to show on the score board is 'No_Name'.

- Main gamepley window:
After pressing "Start Game" the window changes and the randomized board appears, a timer of 3 minutes
starts running.
On the right side of the frame are a few labels:
the timer, the current score, the word currently being formed (all of the currently pressed buttons),
and the words found so far (all features requested in the exercise instructions).
We added two separate buttons for easier control of the gameplay - Check Word and Reset Word.
Any button pressed by the player on the board changes it's color to differ itself from the unpressed buttons
on the board.

More extra features:
- We also tried to add a convenient interface, which includes an intuitive indicator for when a player 
presses an invalid button (either already pressed or not compatible with last pick) - The button turns red
for a few seconds and then goes back to the default "unpressed" color.
- When a word is guessed correctly, a "Correct!" message appears for a few seconds on the frame.
When a word is guessed but has been found already earlier in the game (in the same path or a different one),
a matching message appears ("Already found!") and when a word guessed doesn't appear in the loaded
dictionary (not a word according to the game), a matching message appears as well.
